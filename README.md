# Genetic-Algorithm-Route
The App is written and built with NetBeans 8.2 IDE. It implements modified genetic algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The points in TSP route may be set randomly, in circle and explicitly by the user.
The GUI is designed with use of JavaFX. All GUI elements are in Russian.
The app is unfinished, as it has logic issues and low GA performance.

Executable .jar file is contained in /dist folder.
